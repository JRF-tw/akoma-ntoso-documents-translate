			<!-- introduction about the judiciary history of the law case-->
			<introduction>
				<p> This appeal is against the Ruling of the High Court delivered on the 6<sup>th</sup> February, 2007. In the Ruling, the learned trial judge
                    dismissed the election petition of the appellant on a preliminary point of law.
                    For convenience, the appellant shall be referred to as the petitioner, while the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    respondents shall retain their positions as this is what they were in the court
                    below. </p>
			</introduction>
			<!-- the facts-->
			<background>
				<p> The brief facts, common to both sides and which gave rise to the preliminary
                    issues, were that the petitioner stood as a parliamentary candidate in the
                    Malole Constituency in the Northern Province. Being dissatisfied with the
                    election results, she instructed counsel to petition and a petition was duly
                    filed. After a few days, an amended petition was filed. According to the record,
                    all this was done within 30 days in compliance with <ref id="ref12" href="/ak/act/2006/12/eng@/main.xml#sec96">Section 96 of the Electoral Act
                        No. 12 of 2006</ref> (hereinafter to be referred to as "the Act"). The
                    petition, among other things, sought to declare the election of the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent null and void; declare the appellant as the
                    duly elected Member of Parliament for Malole Constituency and, therefore,
                    entitled to take her seat in the National Assembly and enjoy all the benefits
                    due to that office. </p>

			<!-- the law-->
			<motivation>
				<p>
					<noteRef href="#not1" marker="1"/>
					<omissis>...</omissis>
				</p>
				<p> The preliminary issues, as points of law, were disposed of through submissions
                    by counsel representing the parties to the election petition. Mr. Lambda,
                    counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent, submitted first because
                    he had formally filed the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent's notice to
                    raise preliminary issues. According to the record, the formal notice was in
                    response to the learned trial Judge's observations as to what status to accord
                    the election petition that was not signed by the petitioner herself in
                    compliance with the provisions of Section 96(3) of the Act. </p>
				<p> The preliminary issues raised were in three parts. Without reproducing them, we
                    shall, for the purposes of this appeal, take the first one, which was not only
                    vigorously argued before the lower court and this court but which is also the
                    subject of appeal. </p>
				<p> As recast by counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent and argued
                    by the parties, the issue was: <span class="bold"> whether a petition filed into court and not
                        signed by the petitioner herself can be said to be properly before the court
                        and whether or not the court can entertain the petition or indeed allow an
                        amendment </span>
				</p>
				<p> Mr. Lambda contended before the learned trial Judge that it was a mandatory
                    requirement that the petition is signed by the petitioner in person and not
                    through her legal representative; that an adherence to the procedure provided by
                    the Act was of the utmost importance. </p>
				<p> Counsel contended that the omission by the petitioner, in not signing the
                    petition herself, was so fatal that it rendered the petition dismissible in its
                    current form for want of procedure; that any defect in the petition could only
                    be corrected within 30 days, the period stipulated for bringing the petition to
                    court. </p>
				<p> The record shows that Mr. Kappa, counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    respondent, did not submit before the learned trial Judge because he was
                    constrained by the application on account of what happened on their part during
                    the elections. He, therefore, found it appropriate not to offer any position. </p>
				<p> In response to the submissions by counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    respondent, Mr. Eta, counsel for the petitioner, submitted before the learned
                    trial Judge that the issue that had arisen related to or rested on a proper
                    construction of Section 96(3) of the Act. </p>
				<p> To that extent, counsel told the trial court that a petition was a pleading just
                    like a statement of claim or defence. With reference to <ref id="ref13" href="/en/book/HalsburyLawsEngland/4/en@/main.xml#pag3-par1"> Halsbury's
                        Laws of England. 4th Edition </ref>, counsel submitted that where a pleading
                    is settled by counsel it must be signed by him or her. He, therefore, contended
                    that the petition before the trial court, signed by the petitioner through her
                    counsel, was properly signed as counsel did not have an existence or life
                    independent of a client. </p>

				</p>
			</motivation>
			<decision>
				<p> In summary, our position is that the appeal has no merit. We reiterate our
                    finding that Section 96(3), as read with Section 2(1), makes it mandatory for
                    the petitioner to sign the petition personally under her or his hand before
                    presenting it to the High Court for trial and determination. As this was a novel
                    appeal case on a matter of public interest, we shall make no order for costs.
                    Each party to bear it own costs. </p>
